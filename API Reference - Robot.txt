CLASS: NNAlgaeSensor
********************

METHOD: getSensorValue
----------------------

Description:
	This method does one of { query the world object, query hardware sensors }, depending on whether the robot control program is running in "real" or "simulated" mode. It then constructs an NNAlgaeSensorValue object with the appropriate fields (TO BE DETERMINED) and returns it.
	
Preconditions:
	1. The "world" member must contain a valid reference to an NNWorld object.

Method Definition:
	NNAlgaeSensorValue getSensorValue();
	
Postconditions:
	none.


CLASS: NNCollisionSensor
************************

METHOD: getSensorValue
----------------------

Description:
	This method does one of { query the world object, query hardware sensors }, depending on whether the robot control program is running in "real" or "simulated" mode. It then constructs an NNCollisionSensorValue object with the appropriate fields (TO BE DETERMINED) and returns it.
	
Preconditions:
	1. The "world" member must contain a valid reference to an NNWorld object.

Method Definition:
	NNCollisionSensorValue getSensorValue();
	
Postconditions:
	none.


CLASS: NNOpticalSensor
**********************

METHOD: getSensorValue
----------------------

Description:
	This method does one of { query the world object, query hardware sensors }, depending on whether the robot control program is running in "real" or "simulated" mode. It then constructs an NNOpticalSensorValue object with the appropriate fields (TO BE DETERMINED) and returns it.
	
Preconditions:
	1. The "world" member must contain a valid reference to an NNWorld object.

Method Definition:
	NNOpticalSensorValue getSensorValue();
	
Posconditions:
	none.
